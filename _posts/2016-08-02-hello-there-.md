# Hello there ... 

Before anything else, I thought I'd start by introducing myself.

Lyn Cruz here! I lived in Vancouver, BC for about 14 years. Tons of work experience - pretty much all from customer service.

I am a Hospitality Mangement graduate from Vancouver Community College.

I have to say.. College was one heck of an experience for me! Definitely a _learning experience!_

Before graduating, I was offered a job at the Fairmont Vancouver Airport as a Royal Guest Service Agent. I handled the switchboard area, assisting guests with practically anything they need. It was fun, but it wasn't an easy job. Though, I learned what customer service was really about.
